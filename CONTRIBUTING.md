## Pull Requests

Pull requests are a great way to get your ideas into this repository.

This repository use the [GitHub flow](https://guides.github.com/introduction/flow) as main versioning workflow

1. Fork **this repository**
2. Create a **new branch** for each feature, fix or improvement
3. Send a **pull request** from each feature branch to the **main** branch

It is very important to separate new features or improvements into separate feature branches, and to send a pull request for each branch.

This allows us to review and pull in new features or improvements individually.

When deciding if I merge in a pull request I look at the following things:

### Does it state intent

You should be clear which problem you're trying to solve with your contribution.

For example:

> Add link to code of conduct in README.md

Doesn't tell me anything about why you're doing that

> Add link to code of conduct in README.md because users don't always look in the CONTRIBUTING.md

Tells me the problem that you have found, and the pull request shows me the action you have taken to solve it.

### Is it of good quality

- There are no spelling mistakes
- It reads well
- For english language contributions: Has a good score on [Grammarly](https://www.grammarly.com) or [Hemingway App](https://www.hemingwayapp.com)

### Does it follow the contributor covenant

This repository has a [code of conduct](CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md), I will remove things that do not respect it.

## Style Guide
